# React TypeScript Firebase Chat App

This app uses typescript, firebase and react to create a public forum chat app.
Anyone can sign in with their google account and post a message on the chat and everyone else who accesses this can see the chats other people have posted.
The idea and CSS in this app were derrived from this YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88&t=63s and were modified to work with TypeScript.
